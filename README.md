# tatou
A web platform for pdf watermarking. This project is intended for pedagogical use, and contain security vulnerabilities. Do not deploy on an open network.

## Instructions

The following instructions are meant for a bash terminal on a Linux machine. If you are using something else, you will need to adapt them.

To clone the repo, you can simply run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nharrand/tatou-2026.git
```

Note that you should probably fork the repo and clone your own repo.


### Run python unit tests

```bash
cd tatou/server

# Create a python virtual environement
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate your virtual environement
. .venv/bin/activate

# Install the necessary dependencies
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run the unit tests
export SECRET_KEY="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))')"
python -m pytest
```

### Deploy

From the root of the directory:

```bash
# Create a file to set environement variables like passwords.
cp sample.env .env

# Edit .env and pick the passwords you want

# Generate a signing key, then paste it into SECRET_KEY in .env only.
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'

# Rebuild the docker image and deploy the containers
docker compose up --build -d

# Monitor logs in realtime 
docker compose logs -f

# Test if the API is up
http -v :5000/healthz

# Open your browser at 127.0.0.1:5000 to check if the website is up.
```

`SECRET_KEY` is required: Compose and the application reject an unset or empty
key, and the application rejects the former public development key. Keep
`sample.env` empty for this setting and never commit the real `.env` file.
Each developer should generate a separate local key. Generate the university
deployment's key once, store it privately on that server, and reuse it across
restarts and all server workers. Changing it invalidates existing login tokens,
so users must log in again.

For direct Python runs, export `SECRET_KEY` in the process environment; the
application does not load `.env` itself. The test command above creates a
temporary test key and does not need the deployment key.
